<!--For the "header image", I chose to use a custom made image using photoshop that would act as the header of the webpage.
I did this because my original image, when in the header, would only scale to the left hand side of the display (when in tablet mode).
Therefore, using an image function, I worked round the problem and made it so that it scaled to the middle of the display in different contexts .
 In addition, the stylised look of the custom header adds to the comic book aesthetic that I originally intended within the website's design-->

<!--Here, I have used an Iframe (embedded youtube video) to display the trailer as I wanted to have a high resolution trailer, despite the 25 megabyte file limit .
 The iframe works around it as I dont have to sacrifice quality and trailer length to get around it. In addition, it also adds to the user experience as users can watch suggested videos based around The Batman.
 Therefore, it gratifies them, as well as utilises a platform(YouTube) that the user is familiar with. -->
